🔄 Preprocessing
The following preprocessing techniques are applied:

Resize images to 224 × 224

Random horizontal flipping

Random rotation (-15° to +15°)

Random affine transformations

Normalization using ImageNet mean and standard deviation

🧠 Models
🔹 Custom CNN
2 Convolutional layers
•	ReLU activation
•	MaxPooling
•	Dropout layers
•	Fully connected layers for classification

🔹 Pretrained Models (Transfer Learning)
